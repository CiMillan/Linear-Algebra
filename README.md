# Linear-Algebra

When coding or solving data analysis problems, one problem that can  occur is if your code encounters a special matrix that isn't invertible,  or has an infinite number of eigenvectors, or similar. On other  occasions, for example where you are reducing dimensionality, that might  even be desirable!  So here you will write a code fragment that traps  for different types of special matrices before calling the python  inversion routine, and classifies the type of special case encountered.
